  "body": "### About\r\nA unifying theme of many ongoing trends in software engineering is a blurring of the boundaries between building and operating software products. We explore what we consider to be the logical next step in this succession: integrating runtime monitoring data from production deployments of the software into the tools developers utilize in their daily workflows (i.e., IDEs) to enable tighter feedback loops. We refer to this notion as feedback-driven development (FDD).\r\n\r\nPerformanceHat is an IDE plugin for Eclipse that integrates runtime metrics (e.g., response times) into the source code. It also attempts to predict the performance of newly written code (for now limited to for-loops).\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a 'hotspot' method that is highlighted. Hovering over it yields a summary statistic and the possibility to dig deeper.\r\n\r\n![Performance Hotspots](http://imgur.com/a/lCBY3)\r\n\r\nHere, an example for performance prediction.\r\n\r\n![Performance Prediction on for-loops](http://imgur.com/a/QAD4l)\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\nJ.
